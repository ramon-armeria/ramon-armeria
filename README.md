## 🎯 Why I Study Mathematics
I pursue mathematics with long-term academic focus, guided by structured study plans modeled after top-tier UK university curricula. My study of mathematics is not just academic — it's foundational. I aim to deeply understand the structures and logic that underpin the sciences, language, and even human reasoning. Rather than memorizing results, I focus on reconstructing the ideas from first principles, building everything from the ground up: from Peano axioms to Galois theory, from epsilon-delta definitions to spectral analysis. This portfolio is both a personal archive and a public demonstration of this lifelong pursuit.

This repository documents my structured self-study in mathematics, including:

- Formal notes
- Solved problems and proofs
- Summaries, cheatsheets, and chapter reflections
- Study paths inspired by UK university-level syllabi

### 🎯 Focus Areas
- Abstract Algebra (*Aluffi, Lang*)
- Real & Complex Analysis (*Abbott, Marsden, MIR*)
- Mathematical Logic & Proofs (*Velleman*)
- Electromagnetics and Applied Math
